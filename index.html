<p >Lionel Messi is a football player from Argentina who plays for FC Barcelona.
     He has won the Ballon D'Or, the annual award given to the best player in the world, 7 times, 2022 FIFA World Cup
     winner and an Olympic gold medal winner in 2008. He was born in 1987 in Rosario, 
     Argentina's third-biggest city. He showed an enormous aptitude for football and was in
     the youth teams for Newell's Old Boys, his local team. Faced with mounting medical expenses
     to treat a growth hormone condition, Messi's family accepted an offer to move the 13-year-old
     prodigy to FC Barcelona, who would pay for his treatment. Messi has gone on to become one of 
     the most decorated players in football history and has broken countless records for his
     club and his country</p>
